# This is the project folder for a fan website I made/ am making.

This project is a learning project. It serves to offer me a place to test things and build things as they come to me. I haven't had my hands on React or Bootstrap all that long, and I wanted a fun way to learn. The website breaks a few rules as of this moment such as having buttons that technically do nothing. I do of course intend to at least slightly polish the website before calling it finished.

One should be aware that this fan websites topic is Final Fantasy 14 mostly due to the fact that I thought I could make a funny and interesting joke website to learn off of. That being said the game is based heavily around it's story content. I've taken great care to mostly avoid spoilers to said story. Some characters in said story appear on this website but should be relatively tame and include almost no spoilers. If for some reason you would like a completely spoiler free version of this website and I haven't provided an alternate link yet feel free to request on directly at my email IanSullivanOTI@gmail.com I will try to get at minimum a barer bones version of this website to you sooner than later.

# What works as of this moment

The website has a function home page for the most part with a background, a coursel for some random pictures also featured below.
The Nav bar at the top correctly links to the pages for Home, Mahjong, and "His Shrine".
In Mahjong there a few correctly sized sample "Tile" buttons for a feature I haven't built yet but this was mostly a test to learn some CSS.
In "His Shrine" there is a button with a picture as it's representation that gives a different random encouraging sentiment each time. There's around 7 options though at the moment for sentances you may recieve, and they can randomly repeat but clicking the button will always bring up any sentence that wasn't the previous one.

# What doesn't work but looks like it should

On the homepage there are a few cards I intend to link to pages/routes I haven't created yet. These might be subject to change if I think of a topic I would enjoy having more than what's there.
The "Tile" buttons that don't do anything in the Mahjong page will eventually do something. I'm unsure exactly where I wanna take this feature but I was thinking something along the line of being able to "Make a Hand" out of Mahjong tiles.
Technically the Navbar has a Dropdown menu on it. I haven't bothered deleting it yet because I'm not sure if I want to use it for something soon. It doesn't currently link anywhere though.

# What am I looking at doing

My primary goal is always going to be working on any features I think will help me learn the most the quickest. That spirit is part of why the website might feel sort of jumbled design wise. I do intend to go and clean things up a bit more but in my opinnion having something to look at now is better than nothing even if it's not exactly the cleanest looking. That being said a few items I project getting to semi soon:
-I want to make the button in "His Shrine" clearer it's a button.
-I want to link The Great Serpent of Ronka card on the front page to an actual quiz which will be mostly a joke but serve to explore what building that might be like.
-I want to figure out exactly what I plan to do with this dropdown menu
-I want to finish the Mahjong section so that the user can at least build a hand even if there's no functional use beyond that at the moment.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
